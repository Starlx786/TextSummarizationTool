*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*: The Text Summarization Tool Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a Python-based application developed to automatically generate concise and meaningful summaries from lengthy textual content. In today’s digital era, vast amounts of textual data are produced daily in the form of articles, reports, research papers, and online content. Reading and understanding large documents manually is time-consuming and often inefficient. This project aims to address this challenge by providing an automated system that extracts key information from text and presents it in a summarized form while preserving the original context and meaning.
The application utilizes extractive text summarization techniques, where the most relevant sentences are selected directly from the source text rather than generating new sentences. This approach ensures grammatical correctness and retains the factual accuracy of the original document. The system processes user-provided input text and applies various NLP techniques such as sentence tokenization, word tokenization, stop-word removal, and frequency-based scoring to identify important sentences.
Initially, the input text is segmented into individual sentences using sentence tokenization. This step helps the system analyze the text structure and evaluate the importance of each sentence. Word tokenization is then performed to split sentences into individual words. To enhance the quality of the summary, commonly used words that do not contribute significantly to meaning, known as stop words (such as “is”, “the”, and “and”), are removed from further processing. The remaining meaningful words are used to calculate word frequencies, which serve as indicators of importance within the document.
Each sentence is assigned a score based on the cumulative frequency of its significant words. Sentences containing frequently occurring and meaningful terms receive higher scores, indicating their relevance to the overall content. The system then ranks all sentences according to their scores and selects the top-ranked sentences to form the final summary. The number of sentences included in the summary can be adjusted as per user requirements, making the tool flexible and customizable.
The project is implemented using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, which provides robust functionalities for text processing and linguistic analysis. The application runs entirely offline, making it accessible and efficient without reliance on external APIs or internet connectivity. The design emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and modularity, enabling easy maintenance and future enhancements.
This Text Summarization Tool is beneficial for students, researchers, journalists, and professionals who need quick insights from large volumes of text. It significantly reduces reading time while ensuring essential information is retained. Although the current implementation focuses on extractive summarization, it provides a strong foundation for future improvements such as abstractive summarization using deep learning models, graphical user interfaces, and web-based deployment.
In conclusion, the project successfully demonstrates the practical application of NLP techniques in solving real-world problems. It highlights how automated text summarization can enhance productivity and information accessibility, making it a valuable academic and practical contribution in the field of natural language processing.
